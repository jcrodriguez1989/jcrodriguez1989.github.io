### Cancu (Juan Cruz Rodriguez)

**Software Engineer | Data Scientist | SaaS Builder**

<br/>

I am a PhD-level Data Scientist and Software Engineer passionate about building and scaling data-intensive SaaS products. With a unique background that blends deep technical expertise and years of marketing data science experience, I specialize in transforming complex business challenges into innovative, scalable software solutions.

My experience ranges from academic research to leading data science and engineering teams in fast-paced startup environments. I have a proven track record of developing impactful products by applying a wide range of techniques -from traditional Machine Learning to Large Language Models- to solve complex marketing and software engineering challenges. Key projects include a successful [advertising budget allocation tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpPVttmNJh8) that optimized marketing spend, as well as production-grade models for churn prediction and customer lifetime value.

I am a strong advocate for open-source and have developed numerous R packages for CRAN and Bioconductor, including tools for AI, code optimization, and interactive applications. You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/jcrodriguez1989).

Recently, I started the [_R to Production_](https://rtoprod.com/) blog series, where I share insights on deploying robust data pipelines, APIs, and machine learning models at scale.

#### Juan Cruz Rodriguez

I have a PhD in Computer Science, and I am finishing my master's degree in Applied Statistics (hopefully I will defend the thesis this year `r ji("sweat_smile")`). However, I would like to define myself as a computer science enthusiast. I really enjoy coding. My soul mate programming language is R `r ji("ring")`, however, I sometimes cheat on it with Python, C and C ++ `r ji("stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes")`.
I am always looking to gain new knowledge, no matter what area, but with an emphasis on computer science and statistics.

Science advances thanks to publicly available knowledge, so, for me, open-source coding is ideal. One of the most rewarding experiences is to see how useful for others are a contribution or tool made by me. I am really interested in making Data Science available to everyone.

Thanks to my doctoral studies, I was able to live for a few months in Spain and the United States. This, besides that I love to travel, and I am very good at it, I had the opportunity to visit more than 35 countries:

[ `r ctries` ]

(if your country is not on the list, do not hesitate to invite me `r ji("joy")`).

I love playing futbol `r ji("soccer")`, and I am a fervent fan of [Instituto A.C.C.](http://www.InstitutoACC.com.ar/) (`r lapply(c("soccer", "basketball", "field_hockey", "volleyball"), ji)`, etc.). As a good Argentino, you will see me most of the time carrying and drinking my mate`r tryCatch(ji("mate"), error=function(e) "")`.
